Description: The DataController class manages the data passed throughout the
program. It exposes objects that represent the state of the application (what
models are running, what data is being captured, commands being executed, etc)
and an API for running the models in the data pipeline.


For now, we only have two types of simulations that we want to simulate.
1. Source Simulation.

    In the source simulation, we want to get the I-V and P-V curves of a
    given irradiance, temperature, and model. (Whether to use lookup to
    speed up the process is optional)

    As such, the user should be able to do the basic calls:

    - Set the PVEnvironment to a specific irradiance and temperature.
    - Set the PVSource to a specific model.

    Using the PVEnvironment and PVSource, extract the IV curve.
    This IV curve is stored in the datastore to be retrieved by the
    UIController.

    Since each set of curves should be a separate series (and therefore
    distinguishable by color), the UIController has the responsibility
    to make repeated calls to the DataController to build the SourceModel
    of the appropriate resolution (Lower, Upper, Step values of the
    irradiance and temperature). This involves resetting the DataController
    per pass.

    TODO: Eventually, we want to enable multi-module support for this.
    This means that we should be able to load a file into this method
    to generate the appropriate irradiance and temperature profile
    across a set of modules.

2. MPPT Simulation.

    In the MPPT simulation, we want to get the I-V and P-V curves of both
    the source and MPPT, and then see how the MPPT varies its reference
    voltage over time and affects the source output. We should also be able
    to see the efficiency calculations over time.

    As such, the user should be able to do the basic calls:

    - Set the PVEnvironment to a specific irradiance and temperature.
    - Set the PVSource to a specific model.
    - Set the MPPT to use a specific global, local, and stride algorithm.

    Using the PVEnvironment and PVSource, provide the input for the
    the MPPT to generate a reverence voltage. Calculate the appropriate
    statistics.

    In the next cycle, use the generated VREF to adjust the source
    output and feed back into the MPPT and so on.

    Since all of the data required for the UI is generated cumulatively
    across cycles, we can just cycle through the simulation until the
    end cycle.

    TODO: Eventually, we want to enable multi-module support for this.
    This means that we should be able to load a file into this method
    to generate the appropriate irradiance and temperature profile
    across a set of modules.
