Description: The PVSource (Photovoltaic Cell/Module/Subarray) class is a
concrete base class that provides a common API for derived classes to use. The
PVCell class enables users to retrieve information of the PV model, such as
IV curves, maximum power points, and so on given a set of input conditions.

The following paper discusses how to model multiple module PV sources with
variable shading:

    Accurate Modeling of Partially Shaded PV Arrays (Meyers
    et Mikofski)

    A library developed by these authors is called PVMismatch;
    it can be found at [https://github.com/SunPower/PVMismatch].
    We can potentially draw inspiration on this work to build
    PVSource (This is very hard, since I don't understand their
    code!)

TODO: for now, we'll just use the first module we come across when generating
current and associated IV curve characteristics.
