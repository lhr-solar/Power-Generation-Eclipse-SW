Description: Implementation of the DCDCConverter class.

In a more advanced model, we might tinker with this class to not do 1-1 conversion,
and investigate the sampling timing required in a real system. Doing so will
allow us to develop feedback loop algorithms for the real DC-DC Converter to
push the source to the correct VRef prior to the MPPT step (which assumes our
voltage has reached the correct place and is at steady state).

This class is still useful, however, since it provides a base template for
translation into C/C++ embedded code for the actual MPPT.
